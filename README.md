# UART Command Line Terminal Programming 

# Tasks of this Project:

1. Enabling the tera term terminal to receive the command string in UART recieve interrupt mode
2. check whether the command is valid or not
3. If the command is invalid then get the error messages in the terminal
4. If the command is "LED ON" then turn the in build microcontroller LED
5. If the Command is "LED OFF" turn of the LED
6. If the Command is "COUNTER ON", then Count how many times LED has been ON
7. If the Command is "COUNTER OFF", then Count how many times LED has been OFF
8. If the Command is "COUNTER", then Count the number of time LED ON and LED OFF
9. If the Buffer is full then its overloaded buffer

# future works
1. If the Command is "Move forward", start clockwise motor rotation
2. if the command is "Move backward", start anticlock wise motor rotation.
